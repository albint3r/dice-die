### Obout the game creation
This game was inspired in the game 'Cult of Lamb'.
Is a mini-game inside the main game, the problem was that the game
is just for ona player, and I wanted to make it multiplayer. This is the 
reason for why I made the game.


### State of the game
The first version is finish, this can be played by two persons in the same
computer (The next big step is to make the game online).

- Version pre-pre-pre-Alpha = 0.0.0.1

### What are the next steps for the project?
At the moment the project is over. If other people like the game and want to 
join me to create an online experiences with more features and new version
of the game.

# You only whant to play?
### Rules of the game:
- The player with more points win the game
- The game end when one of the players fulfill their grid.
- If you put a dice in your column and that number value is in the opponent column
you destroy all the dices with the same number.
- The point system is easy: sum the result of the dices, but if in the same column
are two or three numbers of the same value, you multiply the value by the number
of time it appears and then sum all the results.
